# TFT Battler

Work in progress.

My goal is to create a minigame when you have to guess the matchup between 2 tft challengers.
We will check thanks to the API all recent match where the two player face eachothers then, depending of the placement of each player decide who is the winner.

In fact the projet is mainly to demonstrate my skills using AWS serveless services & learn Terraform.
